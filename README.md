# Entity Resolution & Data Quality — Veridion POC

## What this project does
This notebook takes a list of companies and tries to find their best match 
in Veridion's database. It also flags matches that look uncertain.

## How to set it up
1. Make sure you have Python installed (we used version 3.13)
2. Open your terminal and run:
   pip install country_converter thefuzz[speedup] pycountry

## How to run it
1. Open the file `Main_Solution_FINALFINAL_1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
- A CSV/Excel file with company info

## What output it produces
- A table of matched companies
- A list of flagged rows that need human review
